## Design Principles (from JTBD)

### 1. Goal-First Design
Start every flow by asking "What do you want to achieve?" not "Here are features."

### 2. Progressive Commitment
Let users see value before requiring effort (sample data, previews).

### 3. Multiple Paths to Success
Never have a single point of failure (skip CRM, invite later).

### 4. Celebrate Progress
Acknowledge every step completed, no matter how small.

### 5. Personalized Relevance
Show examples and templates matching user's stated context.
